## Content
[TOC]

## Done
- [x] MVP in Python based on this [Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-stock-prices-with-echo-state-networks-f910809d23d4) and the [pyESN library](https://github.com/cknd/pyESN/blob/master/pyESN.py)
- [x] Deconstruction


## Tasks
- [ ] Build a multi-dimensional input vector to a reservoir
- [ ] Several n-dimensional input vector to a reservoir vs only one input vector per reservoir?
- [ ] Deconstruct the following papers:
