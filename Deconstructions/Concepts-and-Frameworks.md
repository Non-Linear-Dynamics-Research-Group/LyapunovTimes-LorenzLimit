- **Project Share at Google Drive:** [Reservoir Computing and Lyapunov Papers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k8CK4sZdLH_wBURhgpL9KALrrVdhGjbQ?usp=sharing) which contains the following:
  * [Referenced papers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TiNeHFyYzE4GM_c3pWGFj6iFEGDmh_1F?usp=sharing) of the [Quanta Magazine Article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-learnings-amazing-ability-to-predict-chaos-20180418/) of which the project got its idea  
  * [Reservoir Computing books](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KjsVNSTHzqYjPzX4l_9fDCL8IwwKsoJj?usp=sharing)
  * [Papers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sTSDBxfW_rJ-CRqvDRx-ehzndIQ6ORbK?usp=sharing) which cited the original 12X-Lyapunov Times paper (aka =orginal paper= you can find in the next paragraph) until April 2022. 
Some papers have added their github repositories containing their code and documentation and shared the used data at Zenodo. One can find the links in the particular paper and partly already downloaded as stored in a directory within this share.
